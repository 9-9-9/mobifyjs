## Capturing - Grumpy Cat

There is nothing more useful then replacing all 
the images of a page with grumpy cats! In a performant 
way of course ;-).

You can view the example in the link below. Be sure to
open up web inspector to see that the original images 
on the site did not download.

## Capturing - Media Queries

In this example, we use media queries in attributes on images 
and scripts to determine which ones will load, just to give you 
an idea of what you can do with Capturing. 

You can view the example in the link below. Be sure to
open up web inspector to see that only the images and scripts
evaluated by the media query are loaded.

## Capturing - Basic Templating

The primary function of Mobify.js 1.1 was client-side templating 
to completely rewrite the pages of your existing site when
responsive doesn't offer enough flexibility, or when changing 
the backend is simply too painful and tedious. It is 
particularly helpful when you need a mobile presence fast. This 
is no longer the primary function of Mobify.js, but it is still 
possible. 

Check out this basic example:
